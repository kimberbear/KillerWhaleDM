# KillerWhaleDM
A Zandronum compatible pk3 based upon Captain Wayne: Vacation Desperation by Ciaran Games<br>
<br>
## Features implemented
Multiple playable Killer Whales as selectable classes<br>
Fast paced Deathmatch gameplay inspired by Quake III Arena<br>
<br>
## Features planned
More Killer Whales (including original ones not included in the game!)<br>
Powerups allowing temporary transformation into boss characters<br>
Deathmatch conversions of CWVD maps (Riptide Rampage or Campaign where possible)<br>
<br>
## Mapping
Download the Ultimate Doom Builder configs and add them to the Configurations folder at your Ultimate Doom Builder installation.<br>
The Ultimate Doom Builder configs are a sight for sore eyes right now so maybe wait a little :P
<br>
## Feel free to contribute or leave feedback!
This is my first Zandronum project (of this scope at least) so if you spot any mistakes or areas of improvement, feel free to contribute or suggest changes!<br>
New features and mapping config improvement are especially welcome at the moment!
