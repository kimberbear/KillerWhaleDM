This Zandronum mod is very early in development.<br>
Many things are likely to change and it won't be surprise if things stop working after updates.<br>

## Features implemented
* Multiple playable Killer Whales as selectable classes
* Powerups allowing temporary transformation into boss characters
* Fast paced Deathmatch gameplay inspired by Quake III Arena

## Features planned
* More Killer Whales (including original ones not included in the game!)
* A set of unique weapons and a special ability per Killer Whale and Boss
* Deathmatch conversions of CWVD maps (Riptide Rampage or Campaign where possible)
* More gamemodes including Skulltag/Capture The Flag and Last Man Standing

## Installation
As this is still very early in development you will need to manually build the game.<br>
Don't worry as it's pretty easy to do and Doom II is not required to play.<br>
Please take extra care at STEP 3! Ensure that the contents of CW-DSD are in the root of the archive, not in a subfolder of the archive of that name! <br>
This is a super common mistake.<br>
1. Download source
2. Zip the contents of CW-DSD- the files inside CW-DSD, not the folder itself -and change it's file extension from ".zip" to ".pk3" 
3. Download Zandronum from the offical website!
4. Put the pk3 and "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe"

From there, you can drag the pk3 onto "zandronum.exe" to start the game.<br>
Hopefully a launcher of some kind will eventually be provided with releases.<br>
The launcher does exist and work, but due to no releases being available, no builds are available from here. <br>
<br>
It is especially important to copy "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe" as it is your stand in for Doom II.<br>
Zandronum won't be able to start without it. If Zandronum asks for the directory to Doom II, you haven't placed "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe"<br>
<br>
If you have issues, please try opening your .pk3/.zip, and ensure all the game files are not in a single folder inside the zip. This will prevent Zandronum and UDB from opening up CW:DSD.<br>
You won't have to worry about this when a release is made, as the .pk3 will be provided prebuilt alongside a launcher!<br>

## Mapping
Download the Ultimate Doom Builder configs and add them to the Configurations folder at your Ultimate Doom Builder installation.<br>
Make sure to enable Killer Whale Deathmatch as an available game, and add the required pk3 archives including the one for CW-DSD.<br>
The Ultimate Doom Builder configs are far from perfect, so be sure to check back for updates or contribute improvements.<br>
<br>
If you make a custom map, you are welcome to share it with the community and if it is deemed to be of a high enough standard, it may be included with the game and you will be credited appropriately!<br>
<br>
You can add additional files via: command line arguments to the Zandronum executable; dragging the additonal files alongside the game files; using the launcher to add addtiional command line arguments.<br>
The launcher will eventually load additional archives automatically and this part of the read me will get updated to reflect that.<br>

## Feel free to contribute or leave feedback!
This is my first Zandronum project (of this scope at least) so if you spot any mistakes or areas of improvement, feel free to contribute or suggest changes!<br>
New features and mapping config improvement are especially welcome at the moment!<br>
