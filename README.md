# KillerWhaleDM
A Zandronum compatible pk3 based upon Captain Wayne: Vacation Desperation by Ciaran Games<br>
## Features implemented
* Multiple playable Killer Whales as selectable classes
* Powerups allowing temporary transformation into boss characters
* Fast paced Deathmatch gameplay inspired by Quake III Arena

## Please note
This Zandronum mod is very early in development.<br>
Many things are likely to change and it won't be surprise if things stop working after updates.<br>

## Features planned
* More Killer Whales (including original ones not included in the game!)
* A set of unique weapons and a special ability per Killer Whale and Boss
* Deathmatch conversions of CWVD maps (Riptide Rampage or Campaign where possible)
* More gamemodes including Skulltag/Capture The Flag and Last Man Standing

## Installation
As this is still very early in development you will need to manually build the game.<br>
Don't worry as it's pretty easy to do and Doom II is not required to play.<br>
1. Download source
2. Zip the contents of KillerWhaleDM and change it's extension from ".zip" to ".pk3"
3. Download Zandronum
4. Put the pk3 and "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe"

From there, you can drag the pk3 onto zandronum to start the game.<br>
<br>
It is especially important to copy "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe" as it is your stand in for Doom II.<br>
Zandronum won't be able to start without it. If Zandronum asks for the directory to Doom II, you haven't placed "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe"<br>

## Mapping
Download the Ultimate Doom Builder configs and add them to the Configurations folder at your Ultimate Doom Builder installation.<br>
Make sure to enable Killer Whale Deathmatch as an available game, and add the required pk3 archives including the one for KillerWhaleDM.<br>
The Ultimate Doom Builder configs are far from perfect, so be sure to check back for updates.<br>

## Feel free to contribute or leave feedback!
This is my first Zandronum project (of this scope at least) so if you spot any mistakes or areas of improvement, feel free to contribute or suggest changes!<br>
New features and mapping config improvement are especially welcome at the moment!<br>
