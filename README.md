# KillerWhaleDM
A Zandronum compatible pk3 based upon Captain Wayne: Vacation Desperation by Ciaran Games<br>
## Features implemented
* Multiple playable Killer Whales as selectable classes
* Fast paced Deathmatch gameplay inspired by Quake III Arena

## Features planned
* More Killer Whales (including original ones not included in the game!)
* A set of unique weapons and a special ability per Killer Whale
* Powerups allowing temporary transformation into boss characters
* Deathmatch conversions of CWVD maps (Riptide Rampage or Campaign where possible)

## Installation
As this is still very early in development you will need to manually build the game.<br>
Don't worry as it's pretty easy to do and Doom II is not required to play.<br>
1. Download source
2. Zip the contents of KillerWhaleDM and change it's extension from ".zip" to ".pk3"
3. Download Zandronum
4. Put the pk3 and "kwgame.wad" into the same directory as "zandronum.exe"

From there, you can drag the pk3 onto zandronum to start the game.<br>

## Mapping
Download the Ultimate Doom Builder configs and add them to the Configurations folder at your Ultimate Doom Builder installation.<br>
The Ultimate Doom Builder configs are a sight for sore eyes right now so maybe wait a little :P<br>

## Feel free to contribute or leave feedback!
This is my first Zandronum project (of this scope at least) so if you spot any mistakes or areas of improvement, feel free to contribute or suggest changes!<br>
New features and mapping config improvement are especially welcome at the moment!
